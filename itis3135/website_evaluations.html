    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <p>This page provides a critical review of two websites using the CRAP design principles.</p>

    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent. Apple uses high contrast between text and background, typically black on white or white on black, making content very legible. Call-to-action buttons ("Buy", "Learn more") stand out clearly against the clean background.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Strong. Consistent typography (San Francisco font), iconography, and layout patterns are used throughout the site, reinforcing the brand identity and making navigation predictable.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Precise. Elements are strictly aligned to a grid system. Text, images, and other components are intentionally placed, creating a clean and organized look that guides the eye naturally down the page.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Effective. Related information is grouped together (e.g., product image with its name and price), while white space is used generously to separate distinct sections, reducing cognitive load.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com" target="_blank">Berkshire Hathaway</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Poor. The site uses default blue hyperlinks on a white background with black text. While legible, it lacks visual hierarchy or distinct contrast for important elements vs. less important ones. It feels outdated.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Weak. There is little stylistic repetition other than the default HTML styling. There is no consistent branding, logo usage, or modern UI components repeated across the site to create a cohesive experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Basic. The layout seems to rely on default browser alignment (left-aligned lists and centered text). It lacks a sophisticated grid or intentional alignment strategy found in modern web design.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Mixed. Links are listed in a somewhat grouped manner, but without visual separation or grouping containers, the page feels like a raw list of files rather than structured content.</li>
        </ul>
